## Installation

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory via command line and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

## Execution

1. Within the project directory, run `node index.js` to start the server.
2. The server will start at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Endpoints

### Articles

- `GET /articles`: Retrieve a list of all articles.
- `POST /articles`: Add a new article. The request body should contain `title`, `content`, and `author`.
- `GET /articles/:articleId`: Retrieve a specific article by its ID.

### Comments

- `GET /articles/:articleId/comments`: Retrieve all comments for a specific article.
- `POST /articles/:articleId/comments`: Add a new comment to a specific article. The request body should contain `content` and `author`.
- `GET /articles/:articleId/comments/:commentId`: Retrieve a specific comment from a specific article.

## Mock Database

The database is simply a JavaScript object exported from `db.js`. You can add, delete, or modify articles and comments directly in this file for testing purposes.

## Known Issues

- The mock database is in-memory, so data will reset upon every server restart.
